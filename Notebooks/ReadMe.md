* Segmentation_model.ipynb : This notebook was created for Adrien Geoffin a volunteer who tested the segmentation model on his personal salamander tracking data (as explained in Appendix B). To run the notebook successfully, you can request access to the full

* Thesis_regid_registration.ipynb : This notebook gathers the work done with regards to the alignment of salamander bodies. This represents the original trials conducted on the question.
The final alignment methods can be found in this repo at [Salamander_Individual_Identification/Identification
/Rigid_alignment.py](https://github.com/SarraLKSC/Salamander_Individual_Identification/blob/main/Identification/Rigid_alignment.py)
* upright_segmentation.ipynb : This notebook includes the definition, training, evaluation and results visualization of the semantic segmentation model.
* Patch-wise-identification.ipynb and evaluation-of-patch-wise-approach.ipynb gather trials done with regards the the patch-wise method used as our second experimental approach for the identification task.
* Feature_engineering.ipynb : This notebook focuses on the choice of feature representation of the salamander print patches. It relied heavily on visualisation of the different candidates of which image moments showed great abilities.
